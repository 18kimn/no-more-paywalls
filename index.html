        Knowledge should be free. There’s a lot more that can be said
        there by people more eloquent and politically developed than
        I, but there is also no need to. It’s as simple as that –
        <em>knowledge should be free</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        This page is a resource list describing how to access
        paywalled and restricted content, and especially academic
        content, for free.
      </p>
      <h3 id="academic-books">Academic books</h3>
      <p>
        Go to
        <a href="https://libgen.is">Library Genesis (LibGen)</a> and
        try to find it there. LibGen’s search parameter is a little
        sensitive, so I would try a few keywords instead of (for
        example) the full title, printing press and publicatoin year.
      </p>
      <p>
        LibGen has a lot, but it doesn’t have everything; if it
        doesn’t, go to the
        <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/850609558335839/"
          >Ask For PDFs from People With Institutional Access</a
        >
        Facebook group. Search for the resource there, and check out
        the flowchart in the group banner to see if any of those
        resources have it available. If they don’t, ask nicely if
        anyone can send a PDF of the book.
      </p>
      <p>
        If that route doesn’t work, you may want to try asking on
        <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AAAARG/">r/AAAARG</a> for
        access to the AAAARG archive. This mostly works for older
        philosophy texts and other books in the humanities.
      </p>
      <p>
        If none of those work, you can try paying for an eBook from a
        retail outlet like Google Books, Amazon, or Barnes and Noble,
        and “returning” it to get a refund. This is somewhat unsafe.
      </p>
      <p>
        If none of these work, your book may only be available in
        print. Check on
        <a href="https://www.worldcat.org/">worldcat.org</a> to see if
        this is the case. You may be out of luck.
      </p>
      <h3 id="academic-articles">Academic articles</h3>
      <ol type="1">
        <li>
          Find and copy the DOI of the article, or digital object
          identifier. This is essentially an ID for academic articles.
          If you can’t find it immediately on the site of the article,
          you can search for it on
          <a href="https://www.crossref.org/guestquery/">CrossRef</a>
        </li>
        <li>
          Go to SciHub and paste it. SciHub’s URL changes quite
          frequently because of legal issues, so the best way is just
          to go to Google and find the current one in your country.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        There is an international network of scholars contributing
        their credentials and labor to make SciHub work, so I’ve never
        had an issue with it. But in case of trouble,<a
          href="#fn1"
          class="footnote-ref"
          id="fnref1"
          role="doc-noteref"
          ><sup>1</sup></a
        >
        you can try some of the following:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Directly email the authors of the resource. They are usually
          very kind!!
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/850609558335839/"
            >Ask For PDFs from People With Institutional Access</a
          >
          as mentioned above. Please follow their contributor
          guidelines :)
        </li>
        <li>
          Ask on
          <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Scholar/">r/Scholar</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
          post with the <strong>#ICanHazPDF</strong> hashtag on
          Twitter (don’t laugh)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3 id="non-academic-articles">Non-academic articles</h3>
      <p>
        Prepend <strong>12ft.io</strong> to the beginning of the URL.
        You can also install the 12ft.io browser extension, or a
        similar one like the
        <a href="https://github.com/iamadamdev/bypass-paywalls-chrome"
          >Bypass Paywalls</a
        >
        extension on Chrome, Firefox, or Edge.
      </p>
      <p>
        For a few other Medium-based sites like Towards Data Science,
        I also like to use
        <a href="https://github.com/manojVivek/medium-unlimited"
          >Medium Unlimited</a
        >.

      <h3 id="share-the-resources">Share the resources</h3>
      <p>
        If you obtained a text through any means other than free and
        accessible resources, you have the opportunity to share that
        resource and ensure others won’t have to jump through the
        hoops you did. Here are a few notes on doing so.
      </p>
      <p>
        Before sharing, we have to make sure the file is shareable.
        Resources often have a lock called a DRM on them to ensure
        that a PDF for you can’t be opened on any other machine
        besides your own.<a
          href="#fn2"
          class="footnote-ref"
          id="fnref2"
          role="doc-noteref"
          ><sup>2</sup></a
        >
        If this is the case, download the eBook viewer
        <a href="https://calibre-ebook.com/download">Calibre</a> and
        use a plugin called
        <a
          href="https://github.com/apprenticeharper/DeDRM_tools/wiki/Exactly-how-to-remove-DRM"
          >DeDRM</a
        >
        to remove it.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you are sure the file is shareable, you can upload it to
        the
        <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/850609558335839/"
          >Ask for PDFs</a
        >
        Facebook Group and to
        <a href="https://wiki.mhut.org/content:how_to_upload"
          >LibGen</a
        >. If you are on the tech-y side, you might also consider
        setting up and hosting a
        <a href="https://manual.calibre-ebook.com/server.html"
          >Calibre server</a
        >.

              An example would be when SciHub stopped uploading
              content due to legal battles at the beginning of 2021<a
                href="#fnref1"
                class="footnote-back"
                role="doc-backlink"

              Some indicators for the case is if you “borrowed” an
              eBook (what the hell is even borrowing an eBook,
              anyhow), have to open the file through Adobe Digital
              Editions, or got it from a retail outlet<a
                href="#fnref2"
                class="footnote-back"
