# read things for free

Knowledge should be free. There's a lot more that can be said there by
people more eloquent and politically developed than I, but there is
also no need to. It's as simple as that -- _knowledge should be free_.

This page is a resource list describing how to access paywalled and
restricted content, and especially academic content, for free.

### Academic books

Go to [Library Genesis (LibGen)](https://libgen.is) and try to find it
there. LibGen's search parameter is a little sensitive, so I would try
a few keywords instead of (for example) the full title, printing press
and publicatoin year.

LibGen has a lot, but it doesn't have everything; if it doesn't, go to
the
[Ask For PDFs from People With Institutional Access](https://www.facebook.com/groups/850609558335839/)
Facebook group. Search for the resource there, and check out the
flowchart in the group banner to see if any of those resources have it
available. If they don't, ask nicely if anyone can send a PDF of the
book.

If that route doesn't work, you may want to try asking on
[r/AAAARG](https://www.reddit.com/r/AAAARG/) for access to the AAAARG
archive. This mostly works for older philosophy texts and other books
in the humanities.

If none of those work, you can try paying for an eBook from a retail
outlet like Google Books, Amazon, or Barnes and Noble, and "returning"
it to get a refund. This is somewhat unsafe.

If none of these work, your book may only be available in print. Check
on [worldcat.org](https://www.worldcat.org/) to see if this is the
case. You may be out of luck.

### Academic articles

1. Find and copy the DOI of the article, or digital object identifier.
   This is essentially an ID for academic articles. If you can't find
   it immediately on the site of the article, you can search for it on
   [CrossRef](https://www.crossref.org/guestquery/)
2. Go to SciHub and paste it. SciHub's URL changes quite frequently
   because of legal issues, so the best way is just to go to Google
   and find the current one in your country.

There is an international network of scholars contributing their
credentials and labor to make SciHub work, so I've never had an issue
with it. But in case of trouble,^[An example would be when SciHub
stopped uploading content due to legal battles at the beginning of
2021] you can try some of the following:

- Directly email the authors of the resource. They are usually very
  kind!!
- [Ask For PDFs from People With Institutional Access](https://www.facebook.com/groups/850609558335839/)
  as mentioned above. Please follow their contributor guidelines :)
- Ask on [r/Scholar](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scholar/).
- post with the **#ICanHazPDF** hashtag on Twitter (don't laugh)

### Non-academic articles

Prepend **12ft.io** to the beginning of the URL. You can also install
the 12ft.io browser extension, or a similar one like the
[Bypass Paywalls](https://github.com/iamadamdev/bypass-paywalls-chrome)
extension on Chrome, Firefox, or Edge.

For a few other Medium-based sites like Towards Data Science, I also
like to use
[Medium Unlimited](https://github.com/manojVivek/medium-unlimited).

### Share the resources

If you obtained a text through any means other than free and
accessible resources, you have the opportunity to share that resource
and ensure others won't have to jump through the hoops you did. Here
are a few notes on doing so.

Before sharing, we have to make sure the file is shareable. Resources
often have a lock called a DRM on them to ensure that a PDF for you
can't be opened on any other machine besides your own.^[Some
indicators for the case is if you "borrowed" an eBook (what the hell
is even borrowing an eBook, anyhow), have to open the file through
Adobe Digital Editions, or got it from a retail outlet] If this is the
case, download the eBook viewer
[Calibre](https://calibre-ebook.com/download) and use a plugin called
[DeDRM](https://github.com/apprenticeharper/DeDRM_tools/wiki/Exactly-how-to-remove-DRM)
to remove it.

If you are sure the file is shareable, you can upload it to the
[Ask for PDFs](https://www.facebook.com/groups/850609558335839/)
Facebook Group and to
[LibGen](https://wiki.mhut.org/content:how_to_upload). If you are on
the tech-y side, you might also consider setting up and hosting a
[Calibre server](https://manual.calibre-ebook.com/server.html).
